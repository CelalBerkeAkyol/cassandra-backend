# Data Science Blog - Backend API üöÄ

This repository contains the backend API for the **Data Science Blog**, a platform designed for data scientists and researchers to showcase their Python notebook projects.

The API provides robust endpoints for user authentication, post management, and media handling. It's built to be secure, scalable, and easy to integrate with a frontend application, allowing users to effortlessly convert Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) into polished, web-friendly articles.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    _(Note: I've used a placeholder for your repository URL.)_

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CelalBerkeAkyol/cassandra-backend
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables.

    ```env
    # Server Configuration
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=3000
    ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173 # Your frontend URL
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

    # Database
    MONGOOSE_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string

    # JWT Secrets
    JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret
    REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_strong_refresh_token_secret

    # Email Service (Optional - for password resets)
    GOOGLE_MAIL=your_gmail_address
    GOOGLE_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
    ```

4.  **Initialize the database with seed data:**

    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    The server will automatically restart on file changes thanks to `nodemon`.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The API will now be running at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you specified).
